# 1.1.1

* __Application Measurement__
  + This release provides features for collecting anonymous statistics on
    application events such as when a user first opens your application. This
    data is collected only if your project contains a GoogleService-Info.plist
    with a valid `GOOGLE_APP_ID`. If you do not wish to have this data reported,
    add the key `enable_app_measurement = false` to your project's
    GoogleService-Info.plist before releasing your application or its next
    update.
